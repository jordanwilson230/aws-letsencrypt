# Dehydrated hook script that employs cli53 to enable dns-01 challenges with AWS Route 53
# - Will automatically identify the correct Route 53 zone for each domain name
# - Supports certificates with alternative names in different Route 53 zones
#
# Aaron Roydhouse <aaron@roydhouse.com>, 2016
# https://github.com/whereisaaron/dehydrated-route53-hook-script
# Based on dehydrated hook.sh template
#
# Requires dehydrated (https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated)
# Requires cli53 (https://github.com/barnybug/cli53)
# Requires bash, jq, mailx, sed, xargs
#
# Requires AWS credentials with access to Route53, with permissions
# to list zones, and to create and delete records in zones.
#
# Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables, or
# Create ~/.aws/credentials file with [default] credentials, or
# Set AWS_PROFILE to name of credentials entry in ~/.aws/credentials
#
# Neither dehydrated nor this script needs to run as root, so don't do it!
#

#
# This hook is called once for every domain that needs to be
# validated, including any alternative names you may have listed.
#
# Creates TXT record is appropriate Route53 domain, and waits for it to sync
